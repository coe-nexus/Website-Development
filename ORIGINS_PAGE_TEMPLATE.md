### SECTION 1: THE OBSERVATION (2019-2020)

**Layout:** Text left, Image/Graphic right

**Content:**
```
H2: The Gap We Saw

[Large opening paragraph]
In 2019, we noticed something disturbing. While wealthy students 
were building businesses, learning to code, and preparing for an 
AI-driven future, underserved students were stuck in the same 
outdated education system their parents endured.

The wealth gap wasn't just about money anymore.
It was about access to leverage.

[Subsection]
H3: Three Observations That Changed Everything

1. [Number in gold, large: "01"]
   Rich students had ChatGPT accounts before most teachers 
   knew what AI was.

2. [Number in gold: "02"]
   Traditional education was teaching skills for jobs that 
   would disappear in 5 years.

3. [Number in gold: "03"]
   The students who needed transformation most had the 
   least access to the tools that could change their lives.
```

**Visual Element:**
- Timeline graphic showing wealth gap widening
- Before/after comparison visual
- Data visualization of opportunity gap
- **File:** `/Assets/education-gap-visualization.svg` (displays the widening education gap from 2010-2030)

### SECTION 2: THE FOUNDER'S JOURNEY

**Layout:** Full-width with founder photo

**Content:**
```
H2: How One Conversation Changed Everything

[Founder photo - professional but approachable]

[Story in founder's voice]
"I'll never forget meeting [Student Name]. Brilliant. Driven. 
Full of potential. But when I asked what they were learning 
in school, I heard: Algebra II. The Revolutionary War. 
Shakespeare.

Nothing wrong with those subjects. But not a single thing 
about:
- How to build a business
- How AI will change the world  
- How to create value
- How to find their purpose

That's when I knew we had to do something."

- [Founder Name], Founder of CoveOfEdu

[Pull quote highlighted in gold]
"Traditional education was preparing students for a world 
that no longer exists."
```

### SECTION 3: THE RESEARCH PHASE (2020-2021)

**Layout:** Grid of findings

**Content:**
```
H2: What We Discovered

We spent 18 months researching:
- What skills students actually needed
- How adults successfully transformed their lives
- Why most education initiatives failed
- What made Carnegie's libraries so revolutionary

[Grid of findings - 4 cards]

Card 1: THE SKILLS GAP
"By 2030, 85% of jobs will require AI literacy. 
Only 3% of schools teach it."
[Source citation]

Card 2: THE MEANING CRISIS  
"Students with technical skills but no purpose 
burn out within 3 years."
[Research link]

Card 3: THE LEVERAGE MULTIPLIER
"One student with AI tools can create a business 
in 90 days that generates $100K+ annually."
[Case study link]

Card 4: THE INFRASTRUCTURE INSIGHT
"Carnegie didn't give people books. 
He gave them access to knowledge—forever."
[Historical context]
```

---

### SECTION 4: THE SOLUTION (2021-2022)

**Layout:** Large centered content with visuals

**Content:**
```
H2: Building the Infrastructure

We realized we weren't building a program.
We were building infrastructure.

The same way Carnegie built libraries for the industrial age,
we needed to build the learning platform for the AI age.

[Visual: Split screen comparison]

LEFT SIDE (Old Model):
❌ One-time classes
❌ Passive learning
❌ Skills without context
❌ Temporary access
❌ No community

RIGHT SIDE (Our Model):
✅ Ongoing platform (Kiver.org)
✅ Learn by building
✅ Skills + Philosophy
✅ Permanent access
✅ Lifelong community

[Callout box with gold accent]
"We needed more than education.
We needed transformation."
```

### SECTION 5: THE 7 TEACHINGS (2022-2023)

[Framework completion]

[Ending statement]
By 2023, we had created more than a curriculum.

mentors, and leaders of tomorrow.
